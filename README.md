This is my first self learning project, and I am going to finish it in the
end of the  12th grade, the project I did is in Udemy, which I use
to learn python. This is my first time writing the code by myself, I do this
because I'm interested in computer and I hope I can be a software engineer in  the future.

This project is about creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game by pyhon, I have a lot of fun
when I was doing it, although I met a lot of problem I still overcomed it by my self,
this is really helpful to my learning. In this project I have leared how to use function,
if and else, for loop, and print, this is the basic of the python, I will practice more to 
expert it, because I believed that the next project will be more harder than this one, 
I need to practice python more ofthen than I do now.
