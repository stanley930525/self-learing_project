This is my first self learning project, and I will finished three of them at the end of the  10th grade, and all of the project I will do is in Udemy which I use to learned python. This is my first time writing the code by my self, I do this because I'm interested in python and I want to be a engineer when I'm grow up.
This project is about creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game by pyhon, I have alot of fun when I was doing it, although I met alot of problem I still solved it by my self, this is really helpful to my learning. In this project I have leared how to use function, if and else, for loop, and print, this is the basic of the python, I will practice more to skilled it, because I believed that the last two project will be more harder than this one, I need to practice python more ofthen than I do now.
